## IDK-40K
### A Warhammer 40k-based Game

The game that we will be implementing is a simplified Warhammer 40k board game. The objective of the game is to 
destroy your enemyâ€™s forces through a turn based combat system. The combat includes movement, charging, long-range,
and melee components. We intend to allow for two players from two different machines to battle each other in the
game over a peer to peer with a Ethernet cable, wireless or switch connection as the connection medium. We will implement the game using primarily Javafx, 
although we may utilize other languages and tools if certain tasks require it.
